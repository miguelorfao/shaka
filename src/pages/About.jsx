        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          In March 2025, Tim and Ruth proudly took over stewardship of Sha-Ka,
          carrying forward its tradition of creating unforgettable dining
          experiences while adding their own heartfelt touch. With a passion for
          hospitality and a shared love for bringing people together, they’ve
          transformed Sha-Ka into a place where every guest feels welcome and
          every occasion feels special. Whether it’s a romantic dinner, a family
          gathering, a night out with friends, or a celebration of life’s
          milestones, Tim and Ruth believe in making each moment glow with
          meaning — always illuminated by the beauty of candlelight. Their
          vision is simple: To create a dining experience that feels timeless,
          personal, and memorable. At Sha-Ka by Candlelight, you’re not just
          enjoying a meal — you’re part of a story, a celebration, and a
          community.
